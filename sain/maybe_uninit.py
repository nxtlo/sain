    """A wrapper type to construct uninitialized instances of `T`.

    This is kinda equivalent to Rust's `MaybeUninit<T>` wrapper.

    The difference is what's happening under the hood is when initializing an instance of this object,
    nothing really is being initialized, until you call `.write()` to initialize the inner value.

    What??
    -----
    Ok, so `MaybeUninit<T>` is in a sense the unsafe equivalent of `Option<T>`, it either contains a value of type `T`,
    or it contains uninitialized memory (`the attribute doesn't exist`).

    However, `MaybeUninit` is unable to tell you whether the value it contains is `Some(T)` or `None`, So you
    as a programmer is responsible for initializing it.

    And by default, `Option<T>` always contain a default value, which is `None`.

    Examples
    --------
    ```py
    # Create a list of 3 uninitialized strings preallocated.
    pool: list[MaybeUninit[str]] = MaybeUninit.uninit_array(3)
    chars = ['a', 'b', 'c']

    for index, uninit in enumerate(pool):
        uninit.write(chars[index])

    assert all(obj.assume_init() for obj in pool)
