"""sain is a set of minimal abstraction that brings Rust's ecosystem to Python.
It offers a few of the core Rust features like `Vec<T>` and `Result<T, E>` and more.
See the equivalent type section below.

Equivalent types
----------------
- `Option<T>` -> `Option[T]` | `Some[T]`
- `Result<T, E>` -> `Result[T, E]`
- `&dyn Error` -> `Error`
- `Vec<T>` -> `Vec[T]`
- `Default<T>` -> `Default[T]`
- `slice::Iter<Item>` -> `Iter[Item]`
- `iter::Iterator<Item>` -> `Iterator[Item]`
- `Box<T>` -> `Box[T]`, not a heap box.
- `cell::Cell<T>` -> `Cell[T]`, slightly different.
- `cell::RefCell<T>` -> `RefCell[T]`, slightly different.
- `sync::LazyLock<T>` -> `Lazy[T]`
- `sync::OnceLock<T>` -> `Once[T]`
- `mem::MaybeUninit<T>` -> `MaybeUninit[T]`

Equivalent macros
-----------------
As decorators.

- `cfg!()` -> `sain.cfg`
- `todo!()` -> `sain.todo`. This is not a decorator.
- `deprecated!()` -> `sain.deprecated`
- `unimplemented!()` -> `sain.unimplemented`
- `#[cfg_attr]` -> `sain.cfg_attr`
- `#[doc()]` -> `sain.doc()`
